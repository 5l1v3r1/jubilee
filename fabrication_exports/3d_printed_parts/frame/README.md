## Print Settings
Print all parts from PLA with the following settings:
* print in the provided orientations
* 0.2mm layer height
* 6 perimeter layers (This is especially critical for parts that have heat-set inserts)
* 2-3mm brim suggested, but not required
* No supports except *left_corner_plate.STL* and *right_corner_plate.STL*

Note: PETG may also work, although it has not been tested.

Note: Parts *cannot* be used if they peel off the print bed. They *must* come out flat.

## Print Quantities

Print one of everything except:
* 4x **printed_pulley_spacer.STL**
* 2x **belt_clasp.STL**
* 3x **z_motor_offset_plate.STL**
