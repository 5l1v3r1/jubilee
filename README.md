Jubilee
=======

Jubilee is an open-source, extensible multi-tool motion platform capable of running GCode for non-loadbearing automation applications.

Out-of-the-box, Jubilee is configured for multimaterial 3D printing and multicolor pen plotting, but we've had success with light liquid-handling and image stitching applications too.

## Build your own Jubilee

The best way to get started is to thumb through the [**Assembly Instructions**](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/wiki/Assembly-Instructions) and [**Bill of Materials**][bom] first.

Then head over to the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/wiki) to start gathering tools and deciding which parts to buy and which parts to make.

## Repository Contents

* **[/cads](/cads)** holds variants of the native design files.
* **[/fabrication_exports](/fabrication_exports)** contains files in formats ready for 3D printing, laser cutting, or quoting an external vendor to make for you.
* **[/software](/software)** holds both the Duet config files and profile settings for common slicer packages.
* **[/assembly_instructions](/assembly_instructions)** contains PDFs that will take you step-by-step to assembling all the parts in the BOM and fabrication exports to create your own Jubilee
