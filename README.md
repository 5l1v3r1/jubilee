Jubilee
=======

Jubilee is an open-source, extensible multi-tool motion platform capable of running GCode for non-loadbearing automation applications.

Out-of-the-box, Jubilee is configured for multimaterial 3D printing and multicolor pen plotting, but we've had success with light liquid-handling and image stitching applications too.
