Jubilee was built to encapsulate all the best practices in hobbyist 3D printing machine design at the time.
As a result, it's a machine that takes inspiration from many many places.
Here's the full list of referenced projects and contributors

## Design Acknowledgments
* Nadya Peek of Machine Agency
  * for the time, expenses, and infrastructure that enabled Jubilee to come together over many iterations
* Eric Moyer
  * for continuous design feedback, manufacturing insights, and help with community engagement
* Sanjay Mortimer and the E3D Team
  * for an open reference for tool coupling
* J Steve White and Tony Akens of the [Railcore](https://railcore.org/) Project
  * for an incredibly well-documented BOM, an example of 3-point bed leveling firmware configs, a great example of community engagement, and openness in sharing and answering questions
